Ladies and gentlemen, from the cockpit - you may have noticed we've just begun our descent {into} {arrivalCity}. {weatherDescent} If you could assist the cabin crew by tidying your tray and handing them any litter as they come around it would be most appreciated. For safety reasons, please turn off all electronic devices or switch them to airplane mode until after we've landed, and please also note that the aircraft toilets will shortly be out of use. Thank you.
