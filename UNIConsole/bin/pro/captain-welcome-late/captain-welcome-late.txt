{greeting} ladies and gentlemen, from the cockpit - this is your captain speaking and I'd like to welcome you onboard the aircraft.

As you will have noticed, we are currently running a bit behind schedule but we'll do everything we can to make up as much time as possible once we're up in the air.

The guys on the ground are loading the final bits of luggage into the aircraft, so I expect us to be on our way very shortly.

If you could help the cabin crew by getting yourselves sat comfortably with seatbelts fastened we should be ready to depart in just a few minutes. For now though, I'd like to thank you for your patience and I hope you enjoy the flight.
